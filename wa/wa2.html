            What's Goodie, I'm LeeLee, and I'm a fashion Icon

            LeeLee James is channeling her engineering education, dance training, and resourcefulness through queer, femme, and Black identities into a wild and wonderful expression of her STEAM art through her YouTube series Twirling Tech Goddess.  As a computer science major at the University of Colorado Boulder, James believes that greater access to technological information, skills, and experiences for those who have been historically marginalized is of the utmost importance in creat- ing an equitable future for all. She is also the proud Mother of the Colorado Chapter of the pioneering and iconic Royal House of LaBeija, and hopes to stimulate greater interest in STEM to the QTBIPOC folks within the ballroom community.
